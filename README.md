# Top-25-Global-Leaderboard-AI-Algorithm
Hi, this is the algorithm I built for the https://terminal.c1games.com/home AI contest. 

I'm currently working on a new algorithm for the next competition and I thought I'd share something I built for fun to help anyone get started. 

This algorithm at its peak had a rating of 2486 and was rated 22nd in the world on August 22nd out of 55000 competitors! It also beat the 2nd best algorithm at the time!  

It currently sits at around 60ish, with a rating of 2153, so it is a good algorithm, but as people modify strategies, it may become outdated.

Please leave a star and Feel free to connect on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-pestov/

I've also attached a screenshot showcasing some wins, including against a 2918-rated algorithm!
